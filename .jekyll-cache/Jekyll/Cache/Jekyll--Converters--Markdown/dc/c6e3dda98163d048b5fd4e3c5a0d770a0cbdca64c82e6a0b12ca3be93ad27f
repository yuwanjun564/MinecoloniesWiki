<p>At the <a href="../../source/buildings/university">University</a>, a <a href="../../source/workers/researcher">Researcher</a> can research various upgrades to your colony. These are split into three trees: Combat, Civilian, and Technology. You access these from the second page of the University GUI.</p>

<p>Each column of a research tree is also the level the University needs to be to begin a research from that column. So:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Research Tree Column</th>
      <th>Minimum University Level</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5 and higher</td>
      <td>5</td>
    </tr>

</table>

<p>You can only choose one column 6 research in each of the Combat, Civilian, and Technology trees.</p>
