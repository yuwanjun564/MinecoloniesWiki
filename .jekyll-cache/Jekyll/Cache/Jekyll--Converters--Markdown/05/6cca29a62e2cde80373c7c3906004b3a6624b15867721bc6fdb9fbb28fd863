<p>Installation via MultiMC is very easy, and works on Windows, Mac and Linux.</p>

<p>Below are the steps you will need to take in order to install the MineColonies Official Modpack to play on the MineColonies official server, or to play MineColonies for singleplayer.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> the MineColonies Official Server uses Minecraft 1.14.4.</p>

<h2 id="getting-multimc">Getting MultiMC</h2>

<p>MultiMC can be downloaded here: <a href="https://multimc.org/#Download">MultiMC download page</a>. Simply choose the version for your operating system and install.</p>

<p>This guide currently assumes that you have the latest version of MultiMC (v. 0.6.7), and will probably not work for older versions. If you already have an older version installed, please update it!</p>

<p>It will also assume that youâ€™re using Minecraft 1.15.2, but will work for any version.</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/images/installation/multimc-download.png" alt="MultiMc Download" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Important Note:</strong> Please <strong><em>do not</em></strong> download and install a copy of MultiMC from any other source besides <a href="https://multimc.org">MultiMC.org</a> or their official <a href="https://github.com/MultiMC/MultiMC5/">GitHub page</a>! MultiMC is free and open source, so copies obtained elsewhere may come bundled with malware, or may come bundled with extra code that can hijack your Mojang account!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="setting-up-multimc">Setting Up MultiMC</h2>

<p>Setting up MultiMC is pretty quick, depending on your download speed. You <strong>do not need an existing Minecraft install</strong>, but you will need to log in with your Mojang account.</p>

<h3 id="account">Account</h3>

<p><img src="../../assets/images/installation/multimc-account.png" alt="Account" /></p>

<p>Click the highlighted button, select â€œManage Accountsâ€, and on the window that appears, fill in your Mojang account details.</p>

<h3 id="create-an-instance">Create an Instance</h3>

<p>Once your account details are squared away, youâ€™ll be able to create an â€œinstance.â€ Instances are MultiMCâ€™s way of separating each version of Minecraft and each different set of mods you wish to install.</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/images/installation/multimc-instance1.png" alt="Instance Button" /></p>

<p>Click the highlighted button, which will bring up this window:</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/images/installation/multimc-instance2.png" alt="Instance Window" /></p>

<p>The button that is important to us here is the one beside the â€œ1.15.2â€, in the above image. If you wish to use a version of Minecraft that <strong>isnâ€™t</strong> 1.15.2, this is where you select it.</p>

<p>You can also fill out the other areas, selecting an icon, naming the instance, and giving it a group:</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/images/installation/multimc-instance3.png" alt="Instance Name" /></p>

<p>When youâ€™re done filling things in, click ok. Youâ€™ll have something like this:</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/images/installation/multimc-instance4.png" alt="Instance Added" /></p>

<h2 id="installing-minecolonies-mod-only">Installing MineColonies Mod Only</h2>

<p>Next, weâ€™ll walk you through setting up your instance to play MineColonies (or any other mod that uses Forge, the steps are the same).</p>

<p>Before we get started, download MineColonies from <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/minecolonies/files/all">this</a> page, selecting the latest 1.15.2 alpha version.</p>

<p>Then, switch back over to MultiMC and click â€œEdit Instanceâ€. The button we are looking for is located here:</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/images/installation/multimc-edit1.png" alt="Edit Instance Button" /></p>

<p>Clicking it brings up this screen:</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/images/installation/multimc-edit2.png" alt="Edit Instance Window" /></p>

<p>On the right side, click the button labeled â€œForgeâ€. Select the appropriate version (for most mods, the version recommended by the Forge team, which is highlighted with a star on the list), and click ok. This downloads and installs Forge for you - no fiddling around with jar files and installers. Next!</p>

<p>On the left side, select â€œLoader modsâ€. This switches the window to one that allows you to install mods to the instance youâ€™re in.</p>

<p>On the left is a button that says Add. Click it and navigate to the location you downloaded MineColonies to, then click â€œOpenâ€. Youâ€™ll have something that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/images/installation/multimc-edit3.png" alt="Edit Instance Add" /></p>

<p>Next, repeat the above steps, except for Structurize (which MineColonies needs to work). You can download Structurize <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/structurize/files/all">here</a>.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s it! Youâ€™re done! MineColonies and Structurize are now installed! Hooray!</p>

<p>To play it, all you need to do is click â€œLaunchâ€, which can be done from either the â€œEdit Instanceâ€ screen, or the right-side menu on MultiMCâ€™s main window.</p>

<h3 id="getting-the-modpack">Getting the Modpack</h3>

<p>Head over to <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/minecolonies-testpack/files">this page</a> on CurseForge and download the zip file for the version of Minecraft you intend to play.</p>

<p>You can filter for your version in the dropdown located on the right side of the page:</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/images/installation/multimc-curse.png" alt="Curse" /></p>

<h3 id="installing-the-modpack">Installing the Modpack</h3>

<p>If you followed along with the â€œSetting up MultiMCâ€ section, you should remember creating an instance. Installing a modpack is almost <em>exactly</em> the same, which one change in the steps: on the â€œAdd Instanceâ€ screen, what we want is this:</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/images/installation/multimc-modpack1.png" alt="Instance Info Modpack" /></p>

<p>On this screen, click the circle, then click the [â€¦] button off to the side (the highlighted area above), then click â€œOkâ€. A window will appear saying things like â€œResolving mod idsâ€¦â€, and â€œDownloading modsâ€¦â€œ-depending on your internet connection, this could take a few minutes.</p>

<p>Andâ€¦ youâ€™re done!</p>
